    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This recipe includes instructions for how to create a chewy crust that's lightly crisp on the bottom using all-purpose flour or bread flour. It makes a dough that is far better (and cheaper!) than any store bought dough or restaurant pizza I have tried.</p>

    <p>Even the tomato sauce is made from scratch! It's wonderfully simple and flavorful, and is the perfect base for layering on lots of cheese and your choice of toppings.</p>
